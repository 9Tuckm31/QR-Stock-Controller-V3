This project is a idea for a desktop application for controlling stock that passes through a small business.

The main purpose of this project was for me to gain the understanding of how a large project is formulated, developed,
and delivered. You may find in this project things that are incorrect and wrong, or that are not done as a industry
standard. Please look past these flaws and see the project work flow for what it is.
